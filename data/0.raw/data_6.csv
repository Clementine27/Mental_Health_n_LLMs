I do find it very helpful to use LLMs in coding because there are some cases when completing coding homework, where I feel the teacher expects me to be able to perform a task that has not been previously demonstrated in class. In these cases, LLMs are incredibly helpful in filling in those gaps in knowledge where I would previously try to use websites like geeksforgeeks and try to find users with similar problems to me. Still, the users on these websites often solved them in very complex ways that I would have a hard time mimicking, even when comparing their solutions to documentation, creating more errors for myself and resulting in some of my poor grades in the past. A problem that arises when I use LLMs is that VSCode Copilot immediately fills in the next line of code according to the instructions provided by the teacher, which, while helpful, creates an issue of making it harder for me personally to use my knowledge to add on to the code where I can. Ultimately, I think LLMs are helpful to me when coding, but my use of them does come from insecurity about being able to do it myself.",6,7,7,5,7,3,5,7,5,7,7,6,5,4,6,5,7,7,7,7,10,2,3,3,2,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,2,4,4,3,4,3,4,4,2,,,3,1,3,2,2,2,2,,3,,1,2

Not only I felt much more insecure about my ability to code, to understand the problem logically, but also I made more and more mistakes as AI is not perfect. It is also harder to debug, to take control over ""its"" code. My research scientist told me that it is way more ok to tell them that I am not confident rather than pretending that I know concepts that I am not familiar with. With AI, it creates a fake conscience that I know something that I am totally not sure of. But deep down, I know that I am not. Thus, believing in it makes me create inaccuracy information, self-doubt, ""other-doubt"" that impact way more negatively than expected. I missed how I feel confident about myself before ChatGPT or Claude came out, or at least before I overused them. I still think they are great tools to learn, even to research only if I know how to use them correctly - maybe try my best first for 2 or 24 hours, then start asking them. I don't know, I am figuring things out and I hope your study will help people like me figure that out too.
