I do find it very helpful to use LLMs in coding because there are some cases when completing coding homework, where I feel the teacher expects me to be able to perform a task that has not been previously demonstrated in class. In these cases, LLMs are incredibly helpful in filling in those gaps in knowledge where I would previously try to use websites like geeksforgeeks and try to find users with similar problems to me. Still, the users on these websites often solved them in very complex ways that I would have a hard time mimicking, even when comparing their solutions to documentation, creating more errors for myself and resulting in some of my poor grades in the past. A problem that arises when I use LLMs is that VSCode Copilot immediately fills in the next line of code according to the instructions provided by the teacher, which, while helpful, creates an issue of making it harder for me personally to use my knowledge to add on to the code where I can. Ultimately, I think LLMs are helpful to me when coding, but my use of them does come from insecurity about being able to do it myself.",Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat disagree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,10,Undergraduate student,Sometimes (1-2 days per week),Sometimes (40-60%),Bachelor's degree,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,Anxiety,,Somewhat relates,Very much relates,Very much relates,Moderately relates,Very much relates,Moderately relates,Very much relates,Very much relates,Somewhat relates,,,Sometimes,Never,Sometimes,Rarely,Rarely,Rarely,Woman,,UMass Amherst,,No,Yes
