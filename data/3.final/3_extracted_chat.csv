That can repeat across players and stages.  \n- **Per-round greeting:** it’s failing because you read `p.round.get(roundIndex)`, but you set `round.set(roundIndex, i)` on the **round scope**, not the player-round scope. Use `stage.currentRound.get(roundIndex)`.  \n- **Greeting list per player:** currently you shuffle **once per game** (`game.set(shuffled_greetings, shuf)`). So no, it’s not per-player.\n\n---\n\n## Minimal fixes\n\n### 1) Stable, no-repeat avatars (per game)  \nIf you want unique avatars per player for the whole game, build one deck once and deal them out:\n\n```js\n// Build a full deck once\nfunction buildAvatarDeck() {\n  const mk = (prefix) => Array.from({ length: 49 }, (_, i) => `${prefix}_${i + 1}.jpg`);\n  return shuffled([...mk(man), ...mk(woman), ...mk(neutral)]); // 147 unique\n}\n\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  // ... your round creation ...\n\n  // Per-player greeting order (see §3)\n  for (const p of game.players) {\n    p.set(greetings_order, shuffled(greetings));\n  }\n\n  // One shared avatar deck for uniqueness across players\n  game.set(avatar_deck, buildAvatarDeck());\n});\n```\n\nThen, in `onStageStart` **don’t** call `sampleImages()` at all—pull one from the deck (or assign once per player and reuse):\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game = stage.currentGame;\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n\n  // Correct round index read\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n\n  for (const p of game.players) {\n    // Assign a persistent avatar once per player\n    if (!p.get(avatar)) {\n      const deck = game.get(avatar_deck) || [];\n      const img = deck.shift();                 // remove from deck\n      game.set(avatar_deck, deck);            // save deck back\n      p.set(avatar, img);\n      p.set(avatar_url, toPublicPath(img));\n    }\n\n    const avatarPath = p.get(avatar_url);\n\n    // Ensure chat array exists\n    const attr = chatV2;\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\n\n    // Kickoff message, per-round greeting pulled from that player's order\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\n    const already = msgs.some(m => m && m.tag === kickoff && m.for === p.id);\n\n    const order = p.get(greetings_order) || greetings; // per-player shuffle\n    const text = order[roundIndex % order.length] || Hi!;\n\n    if (!already) {\n      p.round.append(attr, {\n        text,\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: avatarPath },\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\n        tag: kickoff,\n        for: p.id,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 2) If you prefer a simpler “one avatar per player, random but not unique”  \nDo it once (not per stage) so it doesn’t “reshuffle” every time:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  // ... rounds ...\n  for (const p of game.players) {\n    const imgList = sampleImages();     // 9 distinct per call\n    const chosen = imgList[0];          // pick one deterministically\n    p.set(avatar, chosen);\n    p.set(avatar_url, toPublicPath(chosen));\n    p.set(greetings_order, shuffled(greetings)); // per-player shuffle\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThen in `onStageStart` just read `p.get(avatar_url)` and **don’t** call `sampleImages()` again.\n\n### 3) Fix the round index source\nReplace:\n```js\nconst roundIndex = Number(p.round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n```\nwith:\n```js\nconst roundIndex = Number(stage.currentRound.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n```\n(Or, if you really want it on the player scope, mirror it there when creating rounds.)\n\n---\n\n## Why your current code behaves oddly\n\n- `const imgs = sampleImages(); const image = imgs[2 % imgs.length];`  \n  `imgs.length` is 9, so you always pick index **2**. Every player/stage gets the 3rd element of a fresh random 9-pack → duplicates are likely.\n\n- `game.set(shuffled_greetings, shuf)` then reading `p.round.get(roundIndex)`  \n  `roundIndex` was set on `round`, so `p.round.get(roundIndex)` is undefined. That’s why your per-round pull “isn’t working.” Reading from `stage.currentRound.get(...)` fixes it.\n\n- Per-player shuffle: storing on `game` makes a single order shared by all players. Move to `p.set(greetings_order, shuffled(greetings))` to shuffle per player.\n\nIf you want, I can tweak this to: (a) prevent avatar reuse across **rounds** too, (b) enforce per-**treatment** uniqueness, or (c) rotate through greetings without modulo wrap."

Different players can still get the same image—that’s allowed.\n- **Greetings:** each player has their **own shuffled order**, long enough to cover all rounds, so they don’t repeat within that player either.\n- **roundIndex source:** fixed to `stage.currentRound.get(roundIndex)`, so per-round indexing works.\n\nIf you want the avatar to stay constant and *different* from the per-round `image`, keep `avatar_url` from `deck[0]` (as above) and don’t overwrite `p.set(avatar)` on each stage."

A value set on `round` is **not** visible on `p.round` unless you copy it there. That’s why `p.round.get(roundIndex)` was `undefined` earlier.\n\nAlso, small correction: Empirica has **many stages per round**, not many rounds per stage. A `stage` belongs to exactly one `round`. So it’s fine to use the current round’s index during `onStageStart`.\n\n### Minimal, safe fix (no reliance on `{ round }` in stage callback)\n\n1) Mirror the roundIndex into each player’s round **once per round**:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ game, round }) => {\n  const idx = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n  for (const p of game.players) {\n    p.round.set(roundIndex, idx); // <-- copy from Round -> PlayerRound\n  }\n});\n```\n\n2) Now your `onStageStart` can do exactly what you wanted:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game = stage.currentGame;\n  const attr = chatV2;\n\n  for (const p of game.players) {\n    const roundIndex = Number(p.round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0); // now defined 👍\n\n    // image per player per round (but see note below about repeats)\n    const imgs = sampleImages();        // returns 9 picks (3x3)\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    const avatarPath = toPublicPath(image);\n\n    p.set(avatar, image);             // if you want avatar to change each round\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\n\n    // ... your kickoff message logic ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Why this works\n- You keep using `p.round.get(...)` in `onStageStart`, but now the value exists because you copied it from `round` in `onRoundStart`.\n\n### One more gotcha (optional, but important)\nYour `sampleImages()` returns **9** images each call (and it’s re-randomized every stage). If you have more than 9 rounds, `roundIndex % imgs.length` will start reusing images. If you truly want **no repeats within a player across all rounds**, give each player a prebuilt deck sized to your total round count (as in my previous message), or at least build it once per player in `onGameStart` and index into it with `roundIndex` instead of calling `sampleImages()` every stage.\n\nIf you’re fine with possible repeats after 9 rounds, your current modulo approach is OK."

The order those two handlers fire isn’t something you should rely on, so sometimes the reader runs before the writer → `p.get(imgs)` is `undefined`.\n\n2) Even if the order were stable, initializing **per stage** re-randomizes every stage (undoing your “no repeats within a player across rounds” goal).

You’re not hoping a different `onStageStart` ran first.\n- **No repeats within player:** each player has a fixed deck (`imgs`) and greeting order sized to `totalRounds`. You index by `roundIndex`.\n- **No more “reading 'get' of undefined”:** we guard `p?.round` and make sure `imgs` exists before using it.\n\nIf you really must keep your current structure, at minimum add guards:\n\n```js\nconst imgs = p.get(imgs) || [];\nif (!imgs.length) {\n  p.set(imgs, shuffled(allImages()));\n}\n```\n\n…but moving initialization out of `onStageStart` is the real fix."

Add lazy init.\n- Don’t loop `game.players` blindly in `stage.start`; prefer `round.getPlayers?.()`.\n- Always guard `p.round` before calling `.get`/`.set` on it."

It logs to the server console **and** to a `game.debugEvents` vector you can inspect from the Admin “Game JSON”.\n\n```js\n// ---------- tiny debug helpers ----------\nfunction now() { return new Date().toISOString().slice(11, 23); } // HH:MM:SS.mmm\nfunction slog(where, obj = {}) {\n  const line = `[${now()}][${where}] ${JSON.stringify(obj)}`;\n  console.log(line);\n  return line;\n}\nfunction gappendDebug(game, where, obj) {\n  try {\n    if (!Array.isArray(game.get(debugEvents))) game.set(debugEvents, []);\n    game.append(debugEvents, { t: Date.now(), where, ...obj });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.warn(debug append failed, e);\n  }\n}\nfunction dbg(game, where, obj) {\n  const line = slog(where, obj);\n  gappendDebug(game, where, obj);\n  return line;\n}\n```\n\n### 1) onGameStart — verify players and per-player init actually happen\n```js\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  dbg(game, onGameStart.begin, { playersAtStart: game.players?.length ?? 0 });\n\n  for (const p of game.players || []) {\n    // your init\n    const imgs = sampleImages();\n    p.set(imgs, imgs);\n    p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n\n    dbg(game, onGameStart.setPerPlayer, {\n      playerId: p.id, imgsLen: imgs.length,\n      hasGreetings: !!p.get(shuffled_greetings)\n    });\n  }\n\n  dbg(game, onGameStart.end, { playersAtEnd: game.players?.length ?? 0 });\n});\n```\n\n### 2) onRoundStart — ensure we catch the “player wasn’t present yet” case\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ game, round }) => {\n  const idx = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? -1);\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n  dbg(game, onRoundStart.begin, { roundIndex: idx, playersInRound: players.length });\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    // mirror idx (handy later if you read from p.round)\n    if (p.round) p.round.set(roundIndex, idx);\n\n    // if they missed onGameStart, init NOW\n    if (!p.get(imgs)) {\n      const imgs = sampleImages();\n      p.set(imgs, imgs);\n      dbg(game, onRoundStart.lazyInit.imgs, { playerId: p.id, imgsLen: imgs.length });\n    }\n    if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) {\n      p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n      dbg(game, onRoundStart.lazyInit.greetings, { playerId: p.id });\n    }\n  }\n\n  dbg(game, onRoundStart.end, { roundIndex: idx });\n});\n```\n\n### 3) onStageStart — guard `p.round`, confirm reads are defined, and bail loudly if not\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n  if (!game || !round) {\n    slog(onStageStart.missingGameOrRound, {});\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? -1);\n  const players = (round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\n  dbg(game, onStageStart.begin, { stage: stage.name, roundIndex, playersInLoop: players.length });\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p) { slog(onStageStart.nullPlayer); continue; }\n    if (!p.round) { dbg(game, onStageStart.skipNoPlayerRound, { playerId: p.id }); continue; }\n\n    const imgs = p.get(imgs);\n    const greet = p.get(shuffled_greetings);\n\n    dbg(game, onStageStart.readPerPlayer, {\n      playerId: p.id,\n      hasImgs: !!imgs, imgsLen: imgs?.length ?? 0,\n      hasGreetings: !!greet, greetLen: greet?.length ?? 0\n    });\n\n    // If either missing, throw a very explicit error so the stack points here\n    if (!Array.isArray(imgs) || imgs.length === 0) {\n      throw new Error(`Player ${p.id}: imgs missing in stage.start (roundIndex=${roundIndex})`);\n    }\n    if (!Array.isArray(greet) || greet.length === 0) {\n      throw new Error(`Player ${p.id}: greetings missing in stage.start (roundIndex=${roundIndex})`);\n    }\n\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n    // ...rest of your kickoff message logic...\n  }\n\n  dbg(game, onStageStart.end, { stage: stage.name });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## How this will pinpoint the problem\n\n- If `onGameStart.begin` logs `playersAtStart: 0` **every time**, that explains the consistent failure: your single player attaches after `onGameStart`. The lazy init in `onRoundStart` will fill it in (you’ll see `onRoundStart.lazyInit.*` logs).\n- If `playersAtStart` is `1` but `onStageStart.readPerPlayer` shows `hasImgs: false`, then something later cleared or shadowed the attribute name (typo / scope).\n- If `onStageStart.skipNoPlayerRound` appears, you’re looping a player who hasn’t entered this stage yet—use `round.getPlayers?.()` (as shown) instead of `game.players`.\n\n### Quick sanity checklist (with the logs in place)\n- Do you ever see `onGameStart.setPerPlayer`? If not, your player isn’t present at game start.\n- Do you see `onRoundStart.lazyInit.imgs`? If yes, the fallback is working; `onStageStart` should then show `hasImgs: true`.\n- Do any of the explicit `throw new Error(...)` lines fire? Those messages will point exactly to which player/round failed.\n\nIf you paste the first few lines of the debug output, I can read it and tell you exactly which branch is tripping you up."

If `playersAtStart` was `0`, nothing got set.\n\n2) **You’re reading from a different scope / different object later.**  \n   `p.set(imgs, …)` writes to the **Player** scope. In `stage.start` you must read from the **same Player** (not `p.round`, not a client copy). Your `p.get(imgs)` is correct—*but only* if that `p` is the same Player *and* it really had the value set earlier.\n\nGiven it’s failing **every** time, it’s almost certainly (1). With single-player games, the game can start before the participant is bound to it.\n\nTwo small, bullet-proof ways to make this work without changing your design goals:\n\n---\n\n### Option A (recommended): initialize at the start of Round 1\nThis still happens **before the player sees any stage**, so it satisfies “before they play any rounds,” but guarantees the player exists.\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ game, round }) => {\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? -1);\n  if (roundIndex !== 0) return; // only on the very first round\n\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p) continue;\n    if (!p.get(imgs)) p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\n    if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThen your `onStageStart` reads will work:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue; // guard\n\n    const imgs = p.get(imgs);               // ✅ now defined\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n\n    const order = p.get(shuffled_greetings); // ✅ now defined\n    const text  = order[roundIndex % order.length] || Hi!;\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option B (scoped map): store per-player decks on the Game\nSometimes it’s nice to avoid player-attachment timing entirely. Put the decks on the **game** keyed by player id; the game exists at `onGameStart` and at `stage.start`.\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  game.set(__decks, {}); // plain object map\n});\n\nfunction ensurePlayerDecksOnGame(game, p) {\n  const decks = game.get(__decks) || {};\n  if (!decks[p.id]) {\n    decks[p.id] = {\n      imgs: sampleImages(),\n      greet: shuffled(greetings),\n    };\n    game.set(__decks, decks); // write back\n  }\n  return decks[p.id];\n}\n\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;\n\n    const { imgs, greet } = ensurePlayerDecksOnGame(game, p); // ✅ always available\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    const text  = greet[roundIndex % greet.length] || Hi!;\n\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n    // ... use text for your kickoff message ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Quick sanity check you can run right now\nDrop these two logs in to verify what’s happening:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  console.log(onGameStart players:, game.players?.map(pl => pl.id));\n  for (const p of game.players || []) {\n    p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\n    p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n  }\n});\n\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || stage.currentGame.players || [];\n  console.log(onStageStart players:, players.map(pl => ({\n    id: pl.id, hasImgs: !!pl.get(imgs), hasGreets: !!pl.get(shuffled_greetings)\n  })));\n});\n```\n\nIf `onGameStart players:` prints `[]`, that’s the whole story—your init ran with no players. Option A fixes it cleanly while keeping your “pre-play shuffle” requirement."

But that still doesn’t guarantee the same player has the data later. Three things commonly cause the “I set it, but get is undefined” symptom:\n\n1) **Different player instance / timing.** The player object you touched at `onGameStart` isn’t the same one you’re looping later (or wasn’t fully attached yet).  \n2) **Overwriting later.** Somewhere else you (or a lib) do `p.set(imgs, undefined)` / `p.set(shuffled_greetings, ...)` again.  \n3) **Wrong cohort of players in stage.** `game.players` at stage time can include players not actually in this round/stage (so `p.round` exists for some, not others) or even a “fresh” player object without your attributes.\n\nLet’s prove which it is and fix it in one shot.\n\n## 1) Instrument the set and immediate read-back\nDo this inside `onGameStart` after each `set`:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  console.log(onGameStart players:, game.players?.map(p => p.id));\n  for (const p of game.players || []) {\n    const imgs = sampleImages();\n    p.set(imgs, imgs);\n    p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n\n    // PROBE: read it right back\n    const backImgs = p.get(imgs);\n    const backGreets = p.get(shuffled_greetings);\n    console.log(after set, { id: p.id, hasImgs: !!backImgs, lenImgs: backImgs?.length, hasGreets: !!backGreets, lenGreets: backGreets?.length });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf `hasImgs` is `true` here, the write worked. If later it’s `undefined`, something changed between then and stage time.\n\n## 2) Compare the player IDs you loop later\nLog the IDs you see in `onStageStart`:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n  const players = (round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\n  console.log(onStageStart players:, players.map(p => p.id));\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;  // guard\n    console.log(read check, { id: p.id, hasImgs: !!p.get(imgs), hasGreets: !!p.get(shuffled_greetings) });\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf the IDs differ from `onGameStart`, then you set on one instance and read on another. That’s your answer.\n\n## 3) Bullet-proof fix that keeps your design\nKeep your `onGameStart` loop **and** add a tiny “ensure-initialized” at first use. That way, *even if* the player wasn’t attached (or got a fresh instance), they still have their private shuffle **before** Stage 1 does anything:\n\n```js\nfunction ensurePerPlayerInit(p) {\n  if (!p.get(imgs)) p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\n  if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n}\n\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\n  const players = (round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n  const attr = chatV2;\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;     // skip players not actually in this stage\n\n    // 🔐 guarantees the attrs exist even if onGameStart missed this player\n    ensurePerPlayerInit(p);\n\n    const imgs = p.get(imgs);                          // now defined\n    const greets = p.get(shuffled_greetings);          // now defined\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    const text  = greets[roundIndex % greets.length] || Hi!;\n\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\n    const already = msgs.some(m => m && m.tag === kickoff && m.for === p.id);\n    if (!already) {\n      p.round.append(attr, {\n        text,\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: toPublicPath(image) },\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\n        tag: kickoff,\n        for: p.id,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis does **not** change your behavior; it just makes it impossible to hit `undefined` in stage time.\n\n## 4) Quick grep to catch accidental overwrites\nRun a fast search to be sure nothing clobbers the keys later:\n\n- Search for `set(imgs` and `set(shuffled_greetings` across your server code.\n- Also check any client sync that might set those keys on the client Player (different scope) instead of server Player.\n\n---\n\n### tl;dr\n- Seeing the loop run ≠ your current stage is reading the same Player object with the same attributes.  \n- Add the read-back probe after `set`, log player IDs in both places, and add the one-line `ensurePerPlayerInit` in `onStageStart`. That will both **diagnose** and **eliminate** the failure every single time."

Then `.get(roundIndex)` tries to read on `undefined` → boom.\n\nWhy would `stage.currentRound` be undefined? Two common reasons:\n\n1) Your Empirica version doesn’t expose `stage.currentRound` on the server callback (some do, some don’t).\n2) The callback fired in a context where `stage` exists but its `.currentRound` link isn’t set yet.\n\nFix it by grabbing the round **safely** and guarding before you call `.get(...)`.

Destructuring `({ stage, round })` doesn’t guarantee the framework actually passes a `round` arg; if it doesn’t, `round` is simply `undefined` and `round.get(...)` throws.\n\nYou don’t need `round` at all here. The most reliable pattern is:\n\n1) On `onRoundStart`, copy the round index into each **PlayerRound** once.\n2) On `onStageStart`, read it back from **`p.round`** (which definitely exists for players actually in this stage).\n\nThis avoids any dependency on `stage.currentRound`/`round` being present.\n\n### Minimal patch\n\n```js\n// 1) Mirror the round index into PlayerRound once per round\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ game, round }) => {\n  const idx = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n  const players = (round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;     // player not yet in this round\n    p.round.set(roundIndex, idx);\n  }\n});\n\n// 2) Use the mirrored value on stage start (no need for `round` or `stage.currentRound`)\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game = stage.currentGame;\n  const players = (stage.currentRound?.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\n  const attr = chatV2;\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;     // guard\n\n    // 🔐 read from PlayerRound, which we set in onRoundStart\n    const roundIndex = Number(p.round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n\n    // ensure your per-player init exists (covers timing)\n    if (!p.get(imgs)) p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\n    if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n\n    const imgs  = p.get(imgs) || [];\n    const greets = p.get(shuffled_greetings) || greetings;\n\n    if (!imgs.length) continue;  // defensive guard\n\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\n\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\n    const already = msgs.some(m => m && m.tag === kickoff && m.for === p.id);\n    const text = greets[roundIndex % greets.length] || Hi!;\n\n    if (!already) {\n      p.round.append(attr, {\n        text,\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: toPublicPath(image) },\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\n        tag: kickoff,\n        for: p.id,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Why this works\n\n- Some Empirica versions don’t pass `round` to `onStageStart`, and some don’t expose `stage.currentRound` server-side. Mirroring `roundIndex` to **PlayerRound** sidesteps that variability.\n- `onRoundStart` always fires before any stage in that round, so `p.round` exists there and at `stage.start`.\n- In `stage.start` we iterate players actually in this round (`stage.currentRound?.getPlayers?.()` when available) and guard `p.round` to avoid the “reading 'get' of undefined” crash.\n\nIf you still prefer to resolve the round object in `stage.start`, make it optional:\n\n```js\nconst curRound = stage.currentRound ?? undefined;\nconst roundIndex = Number(curRound?.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n```\n\n…but the mirror-to-PlayerRound approach above is the most robust across Empirica versions."

On the server, `game.currentRound` points to the **round that’s currently active for the game** (and while you’re in Round 1’s stages, that’s always the first round → index 0). It won’t magically give you “which round this specific stage belongs to” unless you advance to the next round.\n\nThe most bullet-proof fix is to **stamp the round index onto each Stage when you create it**, then read it directly from `stage` in `onStageStart`. That avoids any reliance on `game.currentRound`, `stage.currentRound`, or callback arg quirks.\n\n## Do this when creating rounds\n\n```js\nfunction addStageWithIdx(round, name, duration, idx) {\n  const st = round.addStage({ name, duration });\n  st.set(roundIndex, idx);      // <-- stamp the index on the stage itself\n  return st;\n}\n\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  const { numRounds } = game.get(treatment);\n  if (giftFirst) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < numRounds; i++) {\n      const round = game.addRound({ name: `Round ${i + 1}` });\n      if (i === 0) addStageWithIdx(round, introGift, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, choiceGift, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, resultGift, 2, i);\n      round.set(roundIndex, i);\n    }\n    for (let i = numRounds; i < 2 * numRounds; i++) {\n      const round = game.addRound({ name: `Round ${i + 1}` });\n      if (i === numRounds) addStageWithIdx(round, introInvestment, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, choiceInvestment, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, resultInvestment, 2, i);\n      round.set(roundIndex, i);\n    }\n  } else {\n    for (let i = 0; i < numRounds; i++) {\n      const round = game.addRound({ name: `Round ${i + 1}` });\n      if (i === 0) addStageWithIdx(round, introInvestment, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, choiceInvestment, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, resultInvestment, 2, i);\n      round.set(roundIndex, i);\n    }\n    for (let i = numRounds; i < 2 * numRounds; i++) {\n      const round = game.addRound({ name: `Round ${i + 1}` });\n      if (i === numRounds) addStageWithIdx(round, introGift, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, choiceGift, 360, i);\n      addStageWithIdx(round, resultGift, 2, i);\n      round.set(roundIndex, i);\n    }\n  }\n  giftFirst = !giftFirst;\n});\n```\n\n## Then read it in `onStageStart` from the stage itself\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game = stage.currentGame;\n  const attr = chatV2;\n\n  // pull the stamped index (no dependency on currentRound)\n  const roundIndex = Number(stage.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n\n  // prefer players actually in this round/stage\n  const players = stage.currentRound?.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;\n\n    // ensure per-player init exists (covers any timing edge)\n    if (!p.get(imgs)) p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\n    if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n\n    const imgs = p.get(imgs) || [];\n    const greets = p.get(shuffled_greetings) || greetings;\n\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\n\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\n    const already = msgs.some(m => m && m.tag === kickoff && m.for === p.id);\n    const text = greets[roundIndex % greets.length] || Hi!;\n\n    if (!already) {\n      p.round.append(attr, {\n        text,\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: toPublicPath(image) },\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\n        tag: kickoff,\n        for: p.id,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Why this works\n- Each stage carries its round’s index, so `onStageStart` can always compute the correct per-round selection without guessing which round is “current.”\n- You still set `round.set(roundIndex, i)` if you want it elsewhere, but you’re no longer dependent on accessing the round object here.\n- This keeps your “no repeats within a player” logic intact since you’re indexing consistently by the true round number.\n\nIf you’d rather not modify stage creation, the alternative is to mirror the index into `p.round` in `onRoundStart` and read it from `p.round` in `onStageStart`, but stamping it on the Stage is the cleanest for your current structure."

If your stages aren’t completing, you’ll stay in round 0 forever — so `roundIndex` looks stuck.\n\nA few quick things to check/try:\n\n1) **Are stages ending?**  \n   A round advances only after its last stage ends. With your `duration: 360` stages, if you’re not letting the timer expire (or submitting), you’ll never leave round 0.\n\n2) **Are you submitting the stage in the UI?**  \n   In Empirica, stages typically advance when the player clicks a “continue/submit” that calls the client-side submit. Make sure your UI does something like:\n   ```js\n   // client-side\n   const player = usePlayer();\n   const onContinue = () => player?.stage?.submit(); // or the equivalent in your version\n   ```\n   (Button exists on every stage that should end.)\n\n3) **Drop durations for testing.**  \n   Set super-short stage durations to verify round rollover:\n   ```js\n   round.addStage({ name: choiceGift, duration: 3 });\n   round.addStage({ name: resultGift, duration: 1 });\n   ```\n   If `roundIndex` increments with short timers, the problem was “stages never ending”.\n\n4) **Add server logs so you can *see* round boundaries.**\n   ```js\n   Empirica.onRoundStart(({ round }) => {\n     console.log([RoundStart], round.id, round.get(roundIndex));\n   });\n\n   Empirica.onRoundEnded(({ round }) => {\n     console.log([RoundEnded], round.id, round.get(roundIndex));\n   });\n\n   Empirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n     const r = stage.currentRound;\n     console.log([StageStart], stage.name, ridx= + (r?.get(roundIndex)));\n   });\n\n   Empirica.onStageEnded(({ stage }) => {\n     const r = stage.currentRound;\n     console.log([StageEnded], stage.name, ridx= + (r?.get(roundIndex)));\n   });\n   ```\n   If you never see `[RoundEnded]`, you’re not completing stages/rounds.\n\n5) **Avoid `game.currentRound` for indexing UI logic.**  \n   Even when things work, `game.currentRound` is global. Safer is to stamp the index on each stage when you create it and read it from `stage`:\n   ```js\n   // when creating:\n   const st = round.addStage({ name: choiceGift, duration: 360 });\n   st.set(roundIndex, i);\n\n   // onStageStart:\n   const roundIndex = Number(stage.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n   ```\n   Or mirror to PlayerRound in `onRoundStart` and read `p.round.get(roundIndex)` during `onStageStart`.\n\nIf after adding the logs you see stages ending but still no `[RoundEnded]`, ping me with the log lines; that’ll tell us whether the submit path or the timers are the blocker."

If you read during `intro` or `choice`, you’re still in **the same round** → index 0 until `result` ends.\n\nIf you want the correct round index **at any stage**, don’t rely on `game.currentRound`. Just stamp the index onto the **Stage** when you create it and read from `stage` itself.\n\n### Minimal, reliable fix\n\n#### When creating stages (once, in `onGameStart`)\n```js\nfunction addStageWithIdx(round, name, duration, idx) {\n  const st = round.addStage({ name, duration });\n  st.set(roundIndex, idx);       // <- stamp here\n  return st;\n}\n\n// ... inside onGameStart while you’re building rounds ...\nround.set(roundIndex, i);\nif (i === 0) addStageWithIdx(round, introGift, 360, i);\naddStageWithIdx(round, choiceGift, 360, i);\naddStageWithIdx(round, resultGift, 2, i);\n```\n\n(Do the same for Investment rounds and for the other ordering branch.)\n\n#### Then in `onStageStart`:\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const game = stage.currentGame;\n  const attr = chatV2;\n\n  // Always correct, regardless of game.currentRound timing:\n  const roundIndex = Number(stage.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\n\n  // Prefer players actually in this round/stage\n  const players = stage.currentRound?.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;\n\n    // ensure per-player init in case timing is weird\n    if (!p.get(imgs)) p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\n    if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\n\n    const imgs = p.get(imgs) || [];\n    const greets = p.get(shuffled_greetings) || greetings;\n\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\n    const text  = greets[roundIndex % greets.length] || Hi!;\n\n    p.round.set(image, image);\n\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\n    const already = msgs.some(m => m && m.tag === kickoff && m.for === p.id);\n    if (!already) {\n      p.round.append(attr, {\n        text,\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: toPublicPath(image) },\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\n        tag: kickoff,\n        for: p.id,\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Quick sanity checks\n\nAdd these logs to see boundaries explicitly:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ round }) => {\n  console.log([RoundStart], round.get(roundIndex));\n});\nEmpirica.onRoundEnded(({ round }) => {\n  console.log([RoundEnded], round.get(roundIndex));\n});\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  console.log([StageStart], stage.name, idx=, stage.get(roundIndex));\n});\nEmpirica.onStageEnded(({ stage }) => {\n  console.log([StageEnded], stage.name, idx=, stage.get(roundIndex));\n});\n```\n\nIf you see `StageStart: intro/choice/result` with the **same** `idx` across them, that’s correct: they belong to the same round. You’ll see the index increment only when the next round’s stages begin.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d prefer not to touch stage creation, the alternative is to **mirror the index to PlayerRound** in `onRoundStart` and read `Number(p.round.get(roundIndex))` in `onStageStart`. Either approach avoids the `game.currentRound` lag and gives you the correct per-stage round index."

So you’ll *always* see 0 whenever the value isn’t actually there.\n\n### Prove it in one line\nReplace that line temporarily with:\n\n```js\nconst rawIdx = round.get(roundIndex);\nconsole.log(raw roundIndex =, rawIdx, typeof:, typeof rawIdx);\nif (rawIdx === undefined) throw new Error(roundIndex missing on round!);\nconst roundIndex = Number(rawIdx);\n```\n\nIf that throws on your “later” rounds, the value simply isn’t set where you’re reading it.\n\n---\n\n## Two solid ways to make it exist (pick one)\n\n### Option A — stamp the index on **every Stage** at creation\nThis makes `onStageStart` trivial and avoids any ambiguity about “current round”.\n\n```js\nfunction addStageWithIdx(round, name, duration, idx) {\n  const st = round.addStage({ name, duration });\n  st.set(roundIndex, idx);    // stamp here\n  return st;\n}\n\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  const { numRounds } = game.get(treatment) || {};\n  // … your loops …\n  const round = game.addRound({ name: `Round ${i + 1}` });\n  round.set(roundIndex, i);                     // optional\n  if (i === 0) addStageWithIdx(round, introGift, 360, i);\n  addStageWithIdx(round, choiceGift, 360, i);   // <- stamped\n  addStageWithIdx(round, resultGift, 2, i);     // <- stamped\n  // … same for the other block …\n});\n```\n\nThen read it straight from the stage:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const roundIndex = Number(stage.get(roundIndex));\n  // no fallback; if it’s missing, that’s a bug you’ll see\n});\n```\n\n### Option B — mirror to **PlayerRound** at `onRoundStart`, read from `p.round` later\nThis guarantees the value exists for any player actually in the stage.\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ game, round }) => {\n  const idx = Number(round.get(roundIndex));\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n  for (const p of players) if (p?.round) p.round.set(roundIndex, idx);\n});\n\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const players = stage.currentRound?.getPlayers?.() || stage.currentGame.players || [];\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;\n    const idx = p.round.get(roundIndex);\n    if (idx === undefined) throw new Error(PlayerRound missing roundIndex);\n    const roundIndex = Number(idx);\n    // use roundIndex…\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quick sanity checks to run now\n\n- Log what you *built*:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) => {\n  console.log(Built rounds:, game.rounds?.length);\n});\n```\n\n- Log lifecycle to confirm boundaries:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ round }) => {\n  console.log([RoundStart], round.get(roundIndex));\n});\nEmpirica.onRoundEnded(({ round }) => {\n  console.log([RoundEnded], round.get(roundIndex));\n});\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  console.log([StageStart], stage.name, idx(stage)=, stage.get?.(roundIndex));\n});\n```\n\nIf you see `raw roundIndex = undefined` on later rounds, that’s exactly why your previous line kept printing 0—the `|| 0` fallback hid the missing data. Stamping on Stage or mirroring to PlayerRound makes it real and stable."

On the server, `game.currentRound` can lag (it reflects the game’s *global* “current” round and only changes after the previous round fully ends). That’s why you keep seeing `0` during your `choice*` stages.\n\nYou’ve got three robust ways to get the correct index without relying on that:\n\n## Option 1 (cleanest): stamp the index on each Stage at creation\nDo this once when you build the stages, then read it directly from `stage`:\n\n```js\n// when creating stages\nfunction addStageWithIdx(round, name, duration, idx) {\n  const st = round.addStage({ name, duration });\n  st.set(roundIndex, idx);\n  return st;\n}\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const roundIndex = Number(stage.get(roundIndex)); // always correct for this stage\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Option 2: mirror to PlayerRound at `onRoundStart`, read from `p.round`\nThis avoids any dependency on `game.currentRound`/`stage.currentRound`:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onRoundStart(({ game, round }) => {\n  const idx = Number(round.get(roundIndex));\n  const players = round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || [];\n  for (const p of players) if (p?.round) p.round.set(roundIndex, idx);\n});\n\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const players = stage.currentRound?.getPlayers?.() || stage.currentGame.players || [];\n  for (const p of players) {\n    if (!p?.round) continue;\n    const roundIndex = Number(p.round.get(roundIndex));\n    // ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Option 3 (zero refactor): derive the index by locating the Round\nIf you don’t want to change your creation code right now, compute it on the fly:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage, game }) => {\n  const r = stage.currentRound || game.currentRound; // whichever exists\n  if (!r) return;\n\n  const rounds = game.rounds || []; // Empirica exposes the round list\n  const roundIndex = rounds.findIndex(R => R.id === r.id);\n  if (roundIndex < 0) {\n    console.warn(Could not locate round in game.rounds);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // roundIndex is now the true index for THIS stage’s round\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n### Quick sanity check\nAdd these logs to confirm round identity vs index:\n\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage, game }) => {\n  const r = stage.currentRound || game.currentRound;\n  const rounds = game.rounds || [];\n  const idx = r ? rounds.findIndex(R => R.id === r.id) : -1;\n  console.log([StageStart], stage.name, { rId: r?.id, idx });\n});\n```\n\nIf this prints increasing `idx` across rounds during their `choice*` stages, your earlier `0` was just the `game.currentRound` lag. Switching to any of the three patterns above will make your per-round sampling stable and correct."

In Empirica, `roundIndex` was your own custom field (only set if you explicitly `round.set(roundIndex, i)`), whereas **`index` is a built-in** on rounds/stages:\n\n- `stage.currentRound.index` → the round’s 0-based position in `game.rounds`\n- `stage.index` → the stage’s 0-based position within its round\n\nSo switching to `index` works because it’s always populated by the framework, while `roundIndex` wasn’t guaranteed to exist.\n\n### safest way to read it\n```js\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) => {\n  const roundObj = stage.currentRound;\n  const roundIndex =\n    (roundObj && typeof roundObj.index === number && roundObj.index) ??\n    (roundObj?.get?.(index)) ?? 0; // fallback if your build exposes it via get()\n\n  // if you instead want the stage's position within the round:\n  const stageIndex =\n    (typeof stage.index === number && stage.index) ??\n    (stage.get?.(index)) ?? 0;\n\n  // ...use roundIndex for per-round selection...\n});\n```\n\n### quick sanity notes\n- Round names like `Round ${i+1}` are 1-based; `index` is 0-based. If you ever display it, add 1.\n- Don’t confuse `stage.index` (within round) with the round index.\n- You can keep all your per-player shuffle/deck logic as is; just plug in `roundIndex` from above.\n\nIf you want me to tidy your current snippet around this (and remove any leftover `roundIndex` sets), paste it in and I’ll inline the minimal edits."
