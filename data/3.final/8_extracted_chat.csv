Below I’ll give you a clear, practical end-to-end blueprint: design choices, data & tokenization, model architecture, training infra & libraries, compute/data sizing (with simple formulas), training recipe & hyperparams, evaluation, alignment/fine-tuning, and next steps + reading. I’ll include concrete recommendations you can follow whether you want a small experimental model (100M–1B params) or a production-level 7B+ model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Quick TL;DR (pick your path)\\n- **Toy / learning build (0.1M–1B params):** train on a few GBs of cleaned text; use Hugging Face Transformers + Tokenizers + Datasets; single multi-GPU or a small TPU pod. Good to learn internals.\\n- **Medium (1B–7B params):** need multi-GPU training, ZeRO/DeepSpeed or Megatron-DeepSpeed for memory scaling, 10s–100s of billions of tokens. Use mixed precision (bf16/fp16).\\n- **Large (7B–70B+ params):** require distributed training (3D parallelism), lots of compute and high quality data (100B+ tokens for compute-optimal training), production infra, careful evaluation & alignment. Use Megatron-DeepSpeed / DeepSpeed / FlashAttention for performance. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search1\ue202turn0search5\ue201\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 1) Decide scope & constraints\\n- Choose **target parameter count** (e.g., 125M, 1.3B, 7B, 13B, 70B).\\n- Pick a **use case** (chat assistant, code model, domain-specific).\\n- Fix **resource limits**: GPUs (type & count), budget, timeline.\\nThese choices determine dataset size, model depth/width, and whether you need model/pipeline parallelism.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 2) Data (collection, cleaning, and size)\\n- **Sources:** web crawl (CommonCrawl), books, Wikipedia, code repos (if you want code), high-quality curated corpora. Filter for copyright & privacy concerns.\\n- **Cleaning:** dedupe,'"

It’s the first spark that says *“I can make something appear out of nothing.”* You don’t need 70 billion parameters to feel that.\\n\\nDavid Lynch would probably agree — he’s said things like:  \\n> “The ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.”  \\n\\nBut he never said the shallow water wasn’t beautiful.  \\n\\nIf you just want to run a “Hello World” in the spirit of that — the simplest creative act — here’s the cleanest version:\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <iostream>\\nint main() {\\n    std::cout << Hello, world! << std::endl;\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat’s it. A tiny self-contained world.  \\nAnd maybe that’s all you need today — not a model, but a moment of clarity.\\n\\nWould you like me to show you a slightly “Lynchian” version of “Hello, World”? Something surreal, still just a few lines of C++?'"
