That can repeat across players and stages.  \\n- **Per-round greeting:** it’s failing because you read `p.round.get(roundIndex)`, but you set `round.set(roundIndex, i)` on the **round scope**, not the player-round scope. Use `stage.currentRound.get(roundIndex)`.  \\n- **Greeting list per player:** currently you shuffle **once per game** (`game.set(shuffled_greetings, shuf)`). So no, it’s not per-player.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Minimal fixes\\n\\n### 1) Stable, no-repeat avatars (per game)  \\nIf you want unique avatars per player for the whole game, build one deck once and deal them out:\\n\\n```js\\n// Build a full deck once\\nfunction buildAvatarDeck() {\\n  const mk = (prefix) =\u003e Array.from({ length: 49 }, (_, i) =\u003e `${prefix}_${i + 1}.jpg`);\\n  return shuffled([...mk(man), ...mk(woman), ...mk(neutral)]); // 147 unique\\n}\\n\\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) =\u003e {\\n  // ... your round creation ...\\n\\n  // Per-player greeting order (see §3)\\n  for (const p of game.players) {\\n    p.set(greetings_order, shuffled(greetings));\\n  }\\n\\n  // One shared avatar deck for uniqueness across players\\n  game.set(avatar_deck, buildAvatarDeck());\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThen, in `onStageStart` **don’t** call `sampleImages()` at all—pull one from the deck (or assign once per player and reuse):\\n\\n```js\\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) =\u003e {\\n  const game = stage.currentGame;\\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\\n\\n  // Correct round index read\\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\\n\\n  for (const p of game.players) {\\n    // Assign a persistent avatar once per player\\n    if (!p.get(avatar)) {\\n      const deck = game.get(avatar_deck) || [];\\n      const img = deck.shift();                 // remove from deck\\n      game.set(avatar_deck, deck);            // save deck back\\n      p.set(avatar, img);\\n      p.set(avatar_url, toPublicPath(img));\\n    }\\n\\n    const avatarPath = p.get(avatar_url);\\n\\n    // Ensure chat array exists\\n    const attr = chatV2;\\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\\n\\n    // Kickoff message, per-round greeting pulled from that player's order\\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\\n    const already = msgs.some(m =\u003e m \u0026\u0026 m.tag === kickoff \u0026\u0026 m.for === p.id);\\n\\n    const order = p.get(greetings_order) || greetings; // per-player shuffle\\n    const text = order[roundIndex % order.length] || Hi!;\\n\\n    if (!already) {\\n      p.round.append(attr, {\\n        text,\\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: avatarPath },\\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\\n        tag: kickoff,\\n        for: p.id,\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2) If you prefer a simpler “one avatar per player, random but not unique”  \\nDo it once (not per stage) so it doesn’t “reshuffle” every time:\\n\\n```js\\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) =\u003e {\\n  // ... rounds ...\\n  for (const p of game.players) {\\n    const imgList = sampleImages();     // 9 distinct per call\\n    const chosen = imgList[0];          // pick one deterministically\\n    p.set(avatar, chosen);\\n    p.set(avatar_url, toPublicPath(chosen));\\n    p.set(greetings_order, shuffled(greetings)); // per-player shuffle\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThen in `onStageStart` just read `p.get(avatar_url)` and **don’t** call `sampleImages()` again.\\n\\n### 3) Fix the round index source\\nReplace:\\n```js\\nconst roundIndex = Number(p.round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\\n```\\nwith:\\n```js\\nconst roundIndex = Number(stage.currentRound.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\\n```\\n(Or, if you really want it on the player scope, mirror it there when creating rounds.)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why your current code behaves oddly\\n\\n- `const imgs = sampleImages(); const image = imgs[2 % imgs.length];`  \\n  `imgs.length` is 9, so you always pick index **2**. Every player/stage gets the 3rd element of a fresh random 9-pack → duplicates are likely.\\n\\n- `game.set(shuffled_greetings, shuf)` then reading `p.round.get(roundIndex)`  \\n  `roundIndex` was set on `round`, so `p.round.get(roundIndex)` is undefined. That’s why your per-round pull “isn’t working.” Reading from `stage.currentRound.get(...)` fixes it.\\n\\n- Per-player shuffle: storing on `game` makes a single order shared by all players. Move to `p.set(greetings_order, shuffled(greetings))` to shuffle per player.\\n\\nIf you want, I can tweak this to: (a) prevent avatar reuse across **rounds** too, (b) enforce per-**treatment** uniqueness, or (c) rotate through greetings without modulo wrap.",{"_4215":4216,"_4221":47,"_4183":4222,"_4185":4223,"_4118":4119,"_4135":4136,"_4137":4138,"_4139":4138,"_4140":4191,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030},"finish_details",{"_4033":4217,"_4218":4219},"stop","stop_tokens",[4220],200002,"is_complete",[],[],"channel","final",[4227],"e3956cac-6386-495f-b96c-e956873bab71",{"_26":4227,"_4050":4229,"_4072":4205,"_4046":4243},{"_26":4227,"_4052":4230,"_4038":4232,"_4058":4233,"_4064":4065,"_4067":1682,"_4056":4236,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":20,"_4056":4231},{},1757974777.825,{"_4060":4061,"_4062":4234},[4235],"I don't want uniqueness across players, but within players",{"_4108":4237,"_4110":4238,"_4112":4239,"_4114":4240,"_4118":4242,"_4120":-5,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030},[],[],[],{"_4116":4241},[],"97fb81ba0e3e7067-IAD",[4244],"4b56a0b5-7db8-401b-a544-37dfdef4848f",{"_26":4244,"_4050":4246,"_4072":4227,"_4046":4253},{"_26":4244,"_4052":4247,"_4038":4249,"_4058":4250,"_4064":4065,"_4067":1682,"_4056":4252,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":4055,"_4056":4248},{},1757974778.0924501,{"_4060":4061,"_4062":4251},[4091],{"_4093":47,"_4069":47,"_4133":1970,"_4094":4134,"_4118":4242,"_4135":4136,"_4137":4138,"_4139":4138,"_4140":4227,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030,"_4096":47},[4254],"923f7ee6-4f55-43d2-a2a2-c63332228a96",{"_26":4254,"_4050":4256,"_4072":4244,"_4046":4278},{"_26":4254,"_4052":4257,"_4038":4259,"_4058":4260,"_4064":4065,"_4066":32,"_4067":1682,"_4056":4275,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":4146,"_4056":4258},{},1757974779.30111,{"_4060":4161,"_4161":4261,"_4178":4274},[4262,4266,4270],{"_4164":4263,"_4058":4264,"_4167":4265,"_4169":47},"Adjusting player image and greeting rules","Okay, so the user wants each player to have unique images across rounds, meaning no repeats for that player.

The lazy init in `onRoundStart` will fill it in (you’ll see `onRoundStart.lazyInit.*` logs).\\n- If `playersAtStart` is `1` but `onStageStart.readPerPlayer` shows `hasImgs: false`, then something later cleared or shadowed the attribute name (typo / scope).\\n- If `onStageStart.skipNoPlayerRound` appears, you’re looping a player who hasn’t entered this stage yet—use `round.getPlayers?.()` (as shown) instead of `game.players`.\\n\\n### Quick sanity checklist (with the logs in place)\\n- Do you ever see `onGameStart.setPerPlayer`? If not, your player isn’t present at game start.\\n- Do you see `onRoundStart.lazyInit.imgs`? If yes, the fallback is working; `onStageStart` should then show `hasImgs: true`.\\n- Do any of the explicit `throw new Error(...)` lines fire? Those messages will point exactly to which player/round failed.\\n\\nIf you paste the first few lines of the debug output, I can read it and tell you exactly which branch is tripping you up.",{"_4215":5032,"_4221":47,"_4183":5034,"_4185":5035,"_4118":4983,"_4135":4136,"_4137":4138,"_4139":4138,"_4140":5012,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030},{"_4033":4217,"_4218":5033},[4220],[],[],[5037],"0834dbb5-1dd5-4803-9386-c0423200292d",{"_26":5037,"_4050":5039,"_4072":5022,"_4046":5053},{"_26":5037,"_4052":5040,"_4038":5042,"_4058":5043,"_4064":4065,"_4067":1682,"_4056":5046,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":20,"_4056":5041},{},1757976588.443,{"_4060":4061,"_4062":5044},[5045],"so, I can SEE that it's happening. but the get still isn't working. \\n\\nmaybe i'm doing the set wrong? \\n\\n  for (const p of game.players) {\\n    // Avatar/image setup\\n    const imgs = sampleImages();\\n    p.set(imgs, imgs);\\n    const shuf = shuffled(greetings);\\n    p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuf);\\n  }",{"_4108":5047,"_4110":5048,"_4112":5049,"_4114":5050,"_4118":5052,"_4120":-5,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030},[],[],[],{"_4116":5051},[],"97fbadeebfb220d7-IAD",[5054],"4418c40e-5cf0-4d8e-9573-d3bec4231040",{"_26":5054,"_4050":5056,"_4072":5037,"_4046":5063},{"_26":5054,"_4052":5057,"_4038":5059,"_4058":5060,"_4064":4065,"_4067":1682,"_4056":5062,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":4055,"_4056":5058},{},1757976588.8044841,{"_4060":4061,"_4062":5061},[4091],{"_4093":47,"_4069":47,"_4133":1970,"_4094":4134,"_4118":5052,"_4135":4136,"_4137":4138,"_4139":4138,"_4140":5037,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030,"_4096":47},[5064],"21005890-fad0-4ec4-8e98-3e15e0a2c0b9",{"_26":5064,"_4050":5066,"_4072":5054,"_4046":5092},{"_26":5064,"_4052":5067,"_4038":5069,"_4058":5070,"_4064":4065,"_4066":32,"_4067":1682,"_4056":5089,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":4146,"_4056":5068},{},1757976589.680496,{"_4060":4161,"_4161":5071,"_4178":5088},[5072,5076,5080,5084],{"_4164":5073,"_4058":5074,"_4167":5075,"_4169":47},"Diagnosing Empirica issues","I'm trying to figure out why `p.get` isn't returning the expected result, even though `p.set` seems to be working.

If `playersAtStart` was `0`, nothing got set.\\n\\n2) **You’re reading from a different scope / different object later.**  \\n   `p.set(imgs, …)` writes to the **Player** scope.

But that still doesn’t guarantee the same player has the data later. Three things commonly cause the “I set it, but get is undefined” symptom:\\n\\n1) **Different player instance / timing.** The player object you touched at `onGameStart` isn’t the same one you’re looping later (or wasn’t fully attached yet).  \\n2) **Overwriting later.** Somewhere else you (or a lib) do `p.set(imgs, undefined)` / `p.set(shuffled_greetings, ...)` again.  \\n3) **Wrong cohort of players in stage.** `game.players` at stage time can include players not actually in this round/stage (so `p.round` exists for some, not others) or even a “fresh” player object without your attributes.\\n\\nLet’s prove which it is and fix it in one shot.\\n\\n## 1) Instrument the set and immediate read-back\\nDo this inside `onGameStart` after each `set`:\\n\\n```js\\nEmpirica.onGameStart(({ game }) =\u003e {\\n  console.log(onGameStart players:, game.players?.map(p =\u003e p.id));\\n  for (const p of game.players || []) {\\n    const imgs = sampleImages();\\n    p.set(imgs, imgs);\\n    p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\\n\\n    // PROBE: read it right back\\n    const backImgs = p.get(imgs);\\n    const backGreets = p.get(shuffled_greetings);\\n    console.log(after set, { id: p.id, hasImgs: !!backImgs, lenImgs: backImgs?.length, hasGreets: !!backGreets, lenGreets: backGreets?.length });\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIf `hasImgs` is `true` here, the write worked. If later it’s `undefined`, something changed between then and stage time.\\n\\n## 2) Compare the player IDs you loop later\\nLog the IDs you see in `onStageStart`:\\n\\n```js\\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) =\u003e {\\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\\n  const players = (round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\\n  console.log(onStageStart players:, players.map(p =\u003e p.id));\\n\\n  for (const p of players) {\\n    if (!p?.round) continue;  // guard\\n    console.log(read check, { id: p.id, hasImgs: !!p.get(imgs), hasGreets: !!p.get(shuffled_greetings) });\\n    // ...\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIf the IDs differ from `onGameStart`, then you set on one instance and read on another. That’s your answer.\\n\\n## 3) Bullet-proof fix that keeps your design\\nKeep your `onGameStart` loop **and** add a tiny “ensure-initialized” at first use. That way, *even if* the player wasn’t attached (or got a fresh instance), they still have their private shuffle **before** Stage 1 does anything:\\n\\n```js\\nfunction ensurePerPlayerInit(p) {\\n  if (!p.get(imgs)) p.set(imgs, sampleImages());\\n  if (!p.get(shuffled_greetings)) p.set(shuffled_greetings, shuffled(greetings));\\n}\\n\\nEmpirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) =\u003e {\\n  const game  = stage.currentGame;\\n  const round = stage.currentRound;\\n  const players = (round.getPlayers?.() || game.players || []);\\n  const roundIndex = Number(round.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\\n  const attr = chatV2;\\n\\n  for (const p of players) {\\n    if (!p?.round) continue;     // skip players not actually in this stage\\n\\n    // 🔐 guarantees the attrs exist even if onGameStart missed this player\\n    ensurePerPlayerInit(p);\\n\\n    const imgs = p.get(imgs);                          // now defined\\n    const greets = p.get(shuffled_greetings);          // now defined\\n    const image = imgs[roundIndex % imgs.length];\\n    const text  = greets[roundIndex % greets.length] || Hi!;\\n\\n    p.round.set(image, image);\\n    if (!Array.isArray(p.round.get(attr))) p.round.set(attr, []);\\n    const msgs = p.round.get(attr) || [];\\n    const already = msgs.some(m =\u003e m \u0026\u0026 m.tag === kickoff \u0026\u0026 m.for === p.id);\\n    if (!already) {\\n      p.round.append(attr, {\\n        text,\\n        sender: { id: p.id, name: Other Player, avatar: toPublicPath(image) },\\n        createdAt: Date.now(),\\n        tag: kickoff,\\n        for: p.id,\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis does **not** change your behavior; it just makes it impossible to hit `undefined` in stage time.\\n\\n## 4) Quick grep to catch accidental overwrites\\nRun a fast search to be sure nothing clobbers the keys later:\\n\\n- Search for `set(imgs` and `set(shuffled_greetings` across your server code.\\n- Also check any client sync that might set those keys on the client Player (different scope) instead of server Player.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### tl;dr\\n- Seeing the loop run ≠ your current stage is reading the same Player object with the same attributes.  \\n- Add the read-back probe after `set`, log player IDs in both places, and add the one-line `ensurePerPlayerInit` in `onStageStart`.

If your stages aren’t completing, you’ll stay in round 0 forever — so `roundIndex` looks stuck.\\n\\nA few quick things to check/try:\\n\\n1) **Are stages ending?**  \\n   A round advances only after its last stage ends. With your `duration: 360` stages, if you’re not letting the timer expire (or submitting), you’ll never leave round 0.\\n\\n2) **Are you submitting the stage in the UI?**  \\n   In Empirica, stages typically advance when the player clicks a “continue/submit” that calls the client-side submit. Make sure your UI does something like:\\n   ```js\\n   // client-side\\n   const player = usePlayer();\\n   const onContinue = () =\u003e player?.stage?.submit(); // or the equivalent in your version\\n   ```\\n   (Button exists on every stage that should end.)\\n\\n3) **Drop durations for testing.**  \\n   Set super-short stage durations to verify round rollover:\\n   ```js\\n   round.addStage({ name: choiceGift, duration: 3 });\\n   round.addStage({ name: resultGift, duration: 1 });\\n   ```\\n   If `roundIndex` increments with short timers, the problem was “stages never ending”.\\n\\n4) **Add server logs so you can *see* round boundaries.**\\n   ```js\\n   Empirica.onRoundStart(({ round }) =\u003e {\\n     console.log([RoundStart], round.id, round.get(roundIndex));\\n   });\\n\\n   Empirica.onRoundEnded(({ round }) =\u003e {\\n     console.log([RoundEnded], round.id, round.get(roundIndex));\\n   });\\n\\n   Empirica.onStageStart(({ stage }) =\u003e {\\n     const r = stage.currentRound;\\n     console.log([StageStart], stage.name, ridx= + (r?.get(roundIndex)));\\n   });\\n\\n   Empirica.onStageEnded(({ stage }) =\u003e {\\n     const r = stage.currentRound;\\n     console.log([StageEnded], stage.name, ridx= + (r?.get(roundIndex)));\\n   });\\n   ```\\n   If you never see `[RoundEnded]`, you’re not completing stages/rounds.\\n\\n5) **Avoid `game.currentRound` for indexing UI logic.**  \\n   Even when things work, `game.currentRound` is global. Safer is to stamp the index on each stage when you create it and read it from `stage`:\\n   ```js\\n   // when creating:\\n   const st = round.addStage({ name: choiceGift, duration: 360 });\\n   st.set(roundIndex, i);\\n\\n   // onStageStart:\\n   const roundIndex = Number(stage.get(roundIndex) ?? 0);\\n   ```\\n   Or mirror to PlayerRound in `onRoundStart` and read `p.round.get(roundIndex)` during `onStageStart`.\\n\\nIf after adding the logs you see stages ending but still no `[RoundEnded]`, ping me with the log lines; that’ll tell us whether the submit path or the timers are the blocker.",{"_4215":5501,"_4221":47,"_4183":5503,"_4185":5504,"_4118":5443,"_4135":4136,"_4137":4138,"_4139":4138,"_4140":5480,"_4121":4122,"_4070":4030},{"_4033":4217,"_4218":5502},[4220],[],[],[5506],"37b6539d-2d6c-4ea2-9dcb-f71c05b3209e",{"_26":5506,"_4050":5508,"_4072":5491,"_4046":5522},{"_26":5506,"_4052":5509,"_4038":5511,"_4058":5512,"_4064":4065,"_4067":1682,"_4056":5515,"_4071":3389},{"_4054":20,"_4056":5510},{},1757977811.702,{"_4060":4061,"_4062":5513},[5514],"it's for sure moving forward, submitting is happening, and i can see the next stage.
